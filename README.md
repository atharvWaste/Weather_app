# ⛅ Weather App  
## Full-Stack Web Development Internship Project

A **production-style full-stack Weather Application** built using **React** and **Node.js**, focused on real-world development, API handling, and seamless frontend–backend integration.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- Full-stack architecture (**React + Node.js + Express**)
- Real-time weather data integration
- Dynamic UI based on weather conditions
- Optimized state management and API usage
- Internship-ready project structure

---

## 🛠 What I Built

### Frontend (React)

- Component-based UI with **real-time state updates**
- Used **React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)** for state & lifecycle management
- Implemented **conditional rendering** for weather-based icons and UI
- Instant **°C ↔ °F conversion** without additional API calls
- Responsive layout using **CSS**

---

### Backend (Node.js & Express)

- Built **REST APIs** using Express.js
- Secure handling of **third-party Weather API**
- Clean **request–response flow** between backend and frontend
- Structured and reusable backend logic

---

## 🧠 Problems Solved

- Fixed **delayed UI updates** caused by async state handling
- Eliminated **unnecessary re-renders** using proper hook patterns
- Reduced **redundant API calls** to improve performance
- Debugged real **frontend–backend integration issues**

---

## 🧰 Skills Demonstrated

- **React** (Hooks, state management, conditional rendering)
- **Node.js & Express** (REST APIs, middleware)
- **API integration & async programming** (Axios)
- Debugging, refactoring, and clean architecture

---

## ⚙ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **API:** Weather API  
- **Library:** Axios
